# Triton Metal Backend

This directory contains the implementation of the Metal backend for Triton, targeting Apple Silicon GPUs (M1, M2, and M3).

## Overview

The Metal backend provides a high-performance implementation of Triton for Apple Silicon GPUs, with specific optimizations for the M3 architecture. The key features include:

- **M3-specific optimizations**: Takes advantage of 64KB shared memory, 8-wide vectors, and enhanced tensor cores
- **MLX integration**: Integration with Apple's MLX framework for accelerated array computing
- **Hardware detection**: Automatic detection and optimization for different Apple Silicon generations
- **Memory optimization**: Specialized memory layout and management for optimal performance
- **Tensor core acceleration**: Leverages M3's dedicated tensor cores for matrix operations

## Architecture

The Metal backend follows a layered architecture:

1. **TritonMetal Dialect**: MLIR dialect for Metal-specific operations and optimizations
2. **Metal Backend**: Implementation of the Triton backend interface for Metal
3. **Hardware-specific Optimizers**: Specialized optimizers for different Apple Silicon generations
4. **MLX Integration**: Integration with MLX for accelerated array computing
5. **Tensor Core Utilization**: Special paths for utilizing M3 tensor cores

## Testing Framework

The Metal backend includes a comprehensive testing framework:

1. **Dialect-level Tests**: Tests for the Metal dialect operations and transformations
2. **Backend-level Tests**: Tests for the Metal backend implementation
3. **Integration Tests**: Tests for the integration with MLX
4. **Hardware-specific Tests**: Tests targeting specific Apple Silicon generations
5. **Tensor Core Tests**: Tests for M3 tensor core utilization

For more details on the testing framework, see [TESTING.md](python/docs/TESTING.md).

## M3 Optimizations

The Metal backend includes several optimizations specific to the M3 chip:

1. **Larger shared memory**: Utilizes 64KB shared memory for larger tiles and better data reuse
2. **Wider vector operations**: Takes advantage of 8-wide vector operations for improved throughput
3. **Tensor core support**: Uses enhanced tensor cores for matrix operations
4. **Dynamic caching**: Leverages improved cache management for better performance

### Tensor Core Acceleration

The M3 chip includes dedicated tensor cores that can significantly accelerate matrix operations. The Metal backend includes specialized code paths to detect and utilize these tensor cores when available. Key features include:

- Automatic detection of tensor core availability
- Optimal matrix dimension selection for tensor core operations
- Mixed precision support (FP16 computation with FP32 accumulation)
- Automatic fallback to standard implementation when tensor cores aren't beneficial

## Building and Running

The Metal backend can be built as part of the Triton project. It requires:

- macOS with Xcode 15.0 or later
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, or M3)
- CMake 3.20 or later

To build:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DTRITON_ENABLE_METAL=ON ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

To run the Metal tests:

```bash
cd build
./run_metal_tests
```
